Setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Azure Actions in Azure involves several steps. Here is an overview of the process:

Create a new repository or navigate to an existing one in Azure DevOps.

Create a new pipeline by clicking on the "Pipelines" tab in the left-hand menu and then clicking "New pipeline."

Choose the type of code repository you are using (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos), and then select the repository you want to use.

Choose the type of pipeline you want to create (e.g., YAML, Classic editor).

Configure your pipeline by defining your build and release stages, including any necessary tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your application.

Set up any necessary variables or parameters to ensure your pipeline runs correctly.

Configure your triggers to automatically run your pipeline when changes are made to your code.

Save and run your pipeline to ensure that it is working correctly.
